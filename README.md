## About the project-3 (Reviews project)
this vanilla javascript project was made on 20th of March, 2022, after my final practical exams of class XII board. I wanted to make a Rich Text Editor but ended up 
making this. And yes, i just readomly picked this 'deeppink' theme for this project as this color came in recommendation by VS code. maybe this project's source code 
will be used in my future project(s). To add more user data to this review container, just go to the app.js file and add the data to personData array in the form of a 
simple JavaScript object and it will be automatically populated to this box as the next card. Similar concept can be used with the data from *MongoDB* this idea, i will 
use in my **QUIZ APP** of the future JEE project. This project was built with pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. with no external dependencies.
